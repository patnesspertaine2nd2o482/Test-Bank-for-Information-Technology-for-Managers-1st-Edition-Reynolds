  * Today's managers are increasingly expected to successfully oversee and understand information systems -- even when it is an area in which they have had little formal training or expertise. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR MANAGERS is targeted at these future managers who are expected to understand the business implications of information technology. Real world examples show future managers how information technology can be applied to improve their organization. INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FOR MANAGERS provides a framework for managers to understand their important role vis-a-vis information technology and it emphasizes the importance of working effectively with all members of the organization to achieve results.
